InterFace : is a class that only contains references to methods and properties that are to be defined when they are used. 
this is like a contract. this allows for better program maintainability.

Inerfaces im using : IsCool and HasBow. Only boats would have bows, and a boat and a car can be cool, but not all boats are cool. These types of flexability allow for dynamic and precise programing.
