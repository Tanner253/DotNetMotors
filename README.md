InterFace : is a class that only contains references to methods and properties that are to be defined when they are used. 
this is like a contract. this allows for better program maintainability.

Inerfaces im using : IsCool and HasBow. Only boats would have bows, and a boat and a car can be cool, but not all boats are cool. These types of flexability allow for dynamic and precise programing.
##### Application Start

##### Using the Application
![output messages from every method in each class. the "HAS BOW" and "IS COOL" interfaces are utilized, the virtual methods were isreal and the price](/assets/capture2.JPG)

OOP principles stand for Object oriented programming - is a programming language model organized around objects rather than "actions" and data rather than logic.

## Change Log
1.0 submits assignment
1.1 utilizes interface properties and inherited methods i use 2 virtual and 2 abstract and not all classes use all methods or properties and "IS COOL" interfaces are utilized, the virtual methods were isreal and the pric
1.2 adds tests, interface methods, virtual methods, and oop in readme
